<h1 class='module'>D-Infinity Upslope Dependence</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>The D-Infinity Upslope Dependence tool quantifies
the amount each grid cell in the domain contributes to a destination set
of grid cells. D-Infinity flow directions proportion flow from each grid
cell between multiple downslope grid cells. Following this flow field
downslope the amount of flow originating at each grid cell that reaches
the destination zone is defined. Upslope influence is evaluated using a
downslope recursion, examining grid cells downslope from each grid cell,
so that the map produced identifies the area upslope where flow through
the destination zone originates, or the area it depends on, for its flow.</div>
<div class='description'>The figures below illustrate the amount each
source point in the domain x (blue) contributes to the destination point
or zone y (red). If the indicator weighted contributing area function is
denoted I(y;x) giving the weighted contribution using a unit value (1)
from specific grid cells y to grid cells x, then the upslope dependence
is: D(x;y) = I(y;x).</div>
<p align="center"><img src="img/dependence.jpg"></img></p>
<div class='description'>This is useful for example to track where flow
or a flow related substance or contaminant that enters a destination area
may come from.</div>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>D-Infinity Flow Direction Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid giving flow direction by the D-Infinity method where the
    flow direction angle is determined as the direction of the steepest
    downward slope on the eight triangular facets formed in a 3 x 3 grid
    cell window centered on the grid cell of interest.</dd>
  <dt>Destination Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid that encodes the destination zone that may receive flow from
    upslope. This grid must be 1 inside the zone y and 0 over the rest of
    the domain.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Upslope Dependence Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid quantifing the amount each source point in the domain contributes
    to the zone defined by the destination grid.</dd>
